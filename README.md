SQL: Querying and managing data

Marvel Characters

This  project required me to create a database, insert data and categorise it using MIN, AVG,  MAX, COUNT Functions and  CASE Statement. I decided to do a database about 26 marvel characters, including  name, weight, durability and fighting skills of the characters. The below picture is the creation of the database schema and the insertion of rows.

Then I used MAX, MIN and AVG functions.

Next step was to view all the data in a user friendly table using MAX, MIN and AVG functions.

Finally I was required to demonstrate the CASE statement on my  database. The CASE statement went through conditions and returned a value when the first condition was met.
